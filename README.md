# Guru99-Selenium-Test-with-TestNG-Framework

Guru99-Selenium-Test-with-TestNG-Framework is a test automation project developed using Selenium WebDriver with TestNG framework in eclipse to verify the following functionality of Guru99 website. The project includes tests to verify that a user can:

- Login with valid credentials. 
- Login with invalid credentials. 
- Create a New customer 
- Open a new account for the customer. 
- Withdraw money from an existing account (Using the account details from the new account)

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Eclipse IDE
- Maven
- TestNG
- Selenium WebDriver
- Extent Reports Plugin
- Jenkins (for Continuous Integration)

## Getting Started
To get started with Guru99-Selenium-Test-with-TestNG-Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/e-francis/Guru99-Selenium-Test-with-TestNG-framework.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies using Maven. You can do this by navigating to the cloned directory and running the following command:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. Set up the necessary configurations in your test environment, such as the URL of the web application you want to test, the browser you want to use, and other relevant settings. You can do this by modifying the `config.properties` file located in the `src/test/resources` directory.

4. Run the tests using TestNG. You can do this by running the following command from the root directory of the repository:
```bash
mvn test
```
This will execute the sample test cases provided in the repository.

5. View the test results. The test results generated by the Extent Reports Plugin can be found in the `test-output` folder. You can open the HTML report in a web browser to view the results of the test execution.

## Continuous Integration with Jenkins
Guru99-Selenium-Test-with-TestNG-Framework is integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration. Follow these steps to set up Jenkins for continuous integration:

1. Install Jenkins on your server or local machine, if not already installed, and set it up according to your requirements.

2. Create a new Jenkins job to build and run the tests. In the Jenkins job configuration, specify the path to the repository, and configure the build triggers, build steps, and post-build actions as needed.

3. Configure the Maven installation in Jenkins. Navigate to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration, and configure the Maven installation. Make sure the Maven installation path matches the one installed on your machine.

4. Set up the Extent Reports Plugin in Jenkins. Install the Extent Reports Plugin in Jenkins and configure it to generate reports in the `test-output` folder. You can use the following configuration in the Jenkins job configuration to generate Extent Reports:

   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   mvn extentreports:report
   ```

5. Save and run the Jenkins job. Save the Jenkins job configuration and run the job to trigger a build. Jenkins will build the project, run the tests, and generate the Extent Reports in the `test-output` folder.

6. View the test results in Jenkins. Once the Jenkins job completes, you can view the test results in the Extent Reports generated by the plugin. You can access the reports from the Jenkins job dashboard or by navigating to the `test-output` folder in the workspace.
